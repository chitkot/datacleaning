Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
========================================================
Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Dataset
Subset of the original dataset
========================================================

This dataset was generated from a larger dataset from the experiements conducted with 30 individuals who performed six activities (Walking, Walking-Upstairs, Walking-Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying) wearing the smartphone Galaxy S II on the waist. 
Information about these experiments is available at: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. 
The original dataset for the project is available at:

This subset of the larger dataset was generated using the following steps:
1. The test and training sets were combined into a larger dataset
2. Measurements of the mean and standard deviation were extracted to create a smaller dataset. All the variables whose names included "mean" or "std" were retained in the new dataset. 
3. Subject data and activity data (for both test and training groups) were merged with the measurement dataset.
4. New variables names were manually created from the original names and were added to the data set
5. The resulting dataset was melted into a long, thin data set: Variables that identified subject and activities were preserved, all measurement variables were melted into a single column
6. Finally the dataset was recast by computing the average value for values of each measurement variable, by subject and by activity.

For each record in the dataset, it is provided the following:
=============================================================
* The identification number for the subject who performed the activity
* The description of the activity that the subject perfromed 
* The average value, for each subject and each activity, for each measurement on the mean and standard deviation of the variables in the original dataset.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
* 'README.txt'
* 'measuresMeanStdRecast.txt': Tidy dataset created using the steps described above
* 'CodeBook.md': Codebook describing the variables
* 'run_analysis.R': The script for performing the analysis and describing all the data cleaning work performed.
