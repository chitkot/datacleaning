Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Dataset
Subset of the original dataset
========================================================

STUDY DESIGN
============

This dataset was extracted from the Sumsung dataset available at:  
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
The original dataset was part of an experiment conducted with 30 volunteers who were asked to perform 6 activities while wearing the smartphone Samsung Galaxy S II on the wrist. 
Information about these experiments is available at: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

This subset of the dataset was created by following the following steps:  

1. Combined the test and training sets into a larger dataset
2. Extracted measurements of the mean and standard deviation and created a smaller dataset. This new dataset was restricted to to measurements of mean and standard deviations, by searching the variable names and extracting variables that had "mean" or "std" as part of the name. 
3. Merged this measurement dataset with data on subject and activities.
4. Manually created new variable names and labeled the data with the appropriate names.
5. Melted resulting dataset into a long, thin data set: Variables that identified subject and activities were preserved; all measurement variables were melted into a single column
6. Recast the dataset and computed the average value for values of each measurement variable, by subject and by activity.

VARIABLE NAMING CONVENTIONS
===========================

With the exception subject and activity variables, all the measurement variables follow some of the naming conventions that were used in the original dataset: 

* ACC: Accelerometer sensor signal
* GYRO: Gyroscope sensor signal
* X: Signal in the X direction
* Y: Signal in the Y direction
* Z: Signal in the Z direction
* t: Time domain
* f: Frequeny domain
* body: body motion component
* gravity: gravitational component
* Mean: Mean value
* Std: Standard deviation
* Mag: Magnitude
* MeanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
* angle: Angle between two vectors.

VARIABLE DESCRIPTION
====================

* Variables 1 and 2 identify the subjects in the experiments and the activities that the subjects performed.
* Variables 3 through 88 are measurements of means or standard deviations. These variables measure the average value, for each subject and each activity, of the measurements on mean or standard deviation in the original data set.
* Each variable is described in the table below. The variable type and the minimum and maximum values are also provided. 
* The dataset contains 88 variables (the last 86 of which are measurement of mean and standard deviation) and 180 observations
